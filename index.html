        <h2><u>TUBA</u></h2>
        <p>
            Sound on a brass instrument comes from 
            a vibrating column of air inside the 
            instrument. The player makes this col
            umn of air vibrate by buzzing the lips
            while blowing air through a cup or fu
            nnel shaped mouthpiece. To produce hi
            gher or lower pitches, the player adj
            usts the opening between his/her lips
        </p>
        <P>
            While blowing, close your lips to the 
            point that it vibrates in the mouthpie
            ce. Keep blowing and vibrating your li
            ps so that sound gets out of the tuba.
            As tuba is a large brass, try blowing 
            a raspberry into the mouthpiece. That
            's the kind of vibration you are look
            ing at.

            Sound on a brass instrument comes from

            instrument. The player makes this colu
            mn of air vibrate by buzzing the lips 
            while blowing air through a cup or fun
            Nel shaped mouthpiece. To produce high
            er or lower pitches, the player adjust
            s the opening between his/her lips
        </P>
        <P>
            Pitch is controlled through the combination 
            of the following factors: speed of air thr
            ough the instrument (controlled by the pla
            yer's lungs and thoracic diaphragm); diame
            ter and tension of lip aperture (by the pl
            ayer's lip musclesâ€”the embouchure) in the 
            mouthpiece; plus, in a modern horn, the o
            peration of valves by the left hand, whic
            h route the air into extra sections of t
            ubing. Most horns have lever-operated r
            otary valves, but some, especially older
            horns, use piston valves (similar to a
            trumpet's) and the Vienna horn uses doub
            le-piston valves, or pumpenvalves. The 
            backward-facing orientation of the bell 
            relates to the perceived desirability to
            create a subdued sound in concert situa
            tions, in contrast to the more piercing
            quality of the trumpet. A horn without valves is
            known as a natural horn, changing pitch along 
            the natural harmonics of the instrument (simil
            ar to a bugle). Pitch may also be controlled b
            y the position of the hand in the bell, in effe
            ct reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of 
            any note can easily be raised or lowered by ad
            justing the hand position in the bell.[2] The k
            ey of a natural horn can be changed by adding d
            ifferent crooks of different lengths

            uce higher or lower pitches, the pla

            her lips
        </P>
        <P>
            Press your lips together and keep the c
            orners of your mouth tight. Making a s
            ound on a trumpet requires more than j
            ust blowing air into it. Use the prope
            r lip technique for the best tone. Sta
            rt by saying the letter M, and holding
            your lips together right when they tou
            ch each other. Then tighten the corner
            s of your mouth. This is the starting
            mouth position for trumpet playing

            The trombone (German: Posaune, Italian, 
            French: trombone) is a musical instrument
            in the brass family. As with all brass
            instruments, sound is produced when t
            he player's vibrating lips cause the
            air column inside the instrument to
            vibrate. Nearly all trombones use a 
            telescoping slide mechanism to alter t
            he pitch instead of the valves used by
            other brass instruments. The valve tr
            ombone is an exception, using three v
            alves similar to those on a trumpet, 
            and the superbone has valves and a slide.
